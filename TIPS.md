# Survival Guide

*In fall 2021, the DSCI100 TAs posted this super helpful
survival guide on Piazza based on their own past experiences taking the class. 
There are a lot of good tips & advice here, so I made it part of the official
course Canvas page. Thanks TAs!*

## A message from TAs past and present

Hi everyone! We’ve put together this guide to
help you succeed in this class (both in-person and online). Since success can
mean different things for different people, we’ll define it to encompass an
understanding of the concepts, enjoyment of the class, and a good final mark.

-----

DSCI 100 has a few different forms of assessments, each one made for a reason.
We’ve listed them below, along with tips on how to get maximum value from them.

**Worksheets** are designed to help teach a concept (alongside the lectures). They
will guide you through problems and hold your hand as you go through them. A
big piece of advice before you do worksheets is to *do the pre-readings*! DSCI
100’s pre-readings don’t take long, are well-written and readable, and are full
of information that will make the worksheets easier to do. We highly recommend
doing the pre-readings before each lecture and worksheet.

Next up we have **tutorials**. They are a continuation of the worksheet in that
they cover the same concepts, just through different questions and scenarios.
Tutorials are more challenging than worksheets as they won’t provide as much
guidance. Instead, you’ll be required to do more on your own. As this might
result in more error messages, I’ll go over some debugging tips. (1) *Read the
error message!* Errors often come from silly mistakes (misspelled words,
forgotten “)”, etc.) and are easy to fix if you read the error message. (2) If
your kernel is running for a long time (>30 seconds), *restart and run all*. This
can be found through the top bar, under Kernel > Restart & Run all. A solid
understanding of the concept (achieved through *readings, worksheets, and asking
questions in lectures, tutorials, and office hours*) will make tutorials easier.

For both worksheets and tutorials, we encourage *having the textbook open while you work*! 
Sometimes things don't stick if you take notes on the textbook before you do the hands-on
activities, but having the textbook open helps you
form better connections between the material and the applications of each
point. We also recommend *giving the whole assignment a scan before
you start on it*. This is true especially if you're busy. Doing a quick scan is
helpful to gauge the workload of the assignment so you don't end up rushing it
30 minutes before it's due!

**Exams** are held two times during the term to test your understanding of the
concepts. The first is a midterm will be during the regular tutorial time,
and the second is a final in Exam Week. They are not cumulative. To prepare for the exams,
I would highly recommend going over
the *readings/textbook, worksheets, and tutorials*. Make sure you budget your time well
and relied so that you don't have to
scramble in the latter portion of the exams.
There is also a **project** later in the term. More details and tips will be
provided as we get closer to that.

DSCI 100 is not a course designed to trick you. As long as you do the work
(which doesn’t even take too long!), you will be rewarded. If you have any
questions, always feel free to ask. Lectures, tutorials, office hours, and
Piazza are all there to help you learn. We have a bunch of TAs ready to answer
questions (and if we don’t know the answer, we’ll help find someone/some
website/something that does know the answer). The textbook was made
specifically for this course, so it’s a fantastic (and free) resource – it’s so
good that it was mentioned as being helpful for worksheets, tutorials, and
exams.

Thank you for reading this! We hope you have a great and safe semester, and
that you enjoy DSCI 100!

Cheers,

DSCI 100 TAs
